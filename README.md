Final Fullstack Application
Overview
This project was developed as a collaborative effort by a team of five, including myself, as part of our final Fullstack application. The application demonstrates our ability to design and implement a fully functional, end-to-end web solution.

Technologies Used
Back-End
PostgreSQL: Utilized as our database management system to handle persistent data storage.
Java: Served as the core programming language for developing the server-side logic.
RESTful APIs: Implemented to enable seamless communication between the front-end and back-end components.

Front-End
Vue.js: Employed as the primary framework for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
JavaScript: Used extensively for client-side scripting to enhance interactivity.
CSS & HTML: Provided the foundational styling and structure for the web pages.
Bootstrap: Integrated to ensure a mobile-first, responsive design with prebuilt components.

Key Features
Seamless Integration: Our application leverages RESTful APIs to ensure smooth data flow between the back-end and front-end, providing users with a fast and responsive experience.
Responsive Design: The front-end was meticulously designed using Vue.js and Bootstrap, ensuring the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.

Contributions
As a team, we divided the responsibilities and worked closely to ensure the successful completion of this project. My contributions included:

Back-End Development: Setting up the database with PostgreSQL.
Front-End Development: Designing and implementing responsive user interfaces using Vue.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

Conclusion
This project reflects our collective expertise in fullstack development, demonstrating our ability to create a complete web application from the ground up. It was a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of teamwork, communication, and technical proficiency in building modern web applications.
